part of a yearold tom cruise expressed an interest in portraying the character though his superstar asking price was never taken seriously cameron considered jared leto for the role but he refused to audition dicaprio  years old at the time was brought to camerons attention by casting director mali finn initially he did not want to portray the character and refused to read his first romantic scene on the set see below cameron said he read it once then started goofing around and i could never get him to focus on it again but for one split second a shaft of light came down from the heavens and lit up the forest cameron strongly believed in dicaprios acting ability and told him look im not going to make this guy brooding and neurotic im not going to give him a tic and a limp and all the things you want cameron rather envisioned the character as a james stewart typekate winslet as rose dewitt bukater cameron said winslet had the thing that you look for and that there was a quality in

hepburn type and was initially uncertain about casting winslet even after her screen test impressed him after she screen tested with dicaprio winslet was so thoroughly impressed with him that she whispered to cameron hes great even if you dont pick me pick him winslet sent cameron a single rose with a card signed from your rose and lobbied him by phone you dont understand she pleaded one day

spirit and winslets spirit stated cameron i saw this joie de vivre in both of them that i thought the audience would be able to make that cognitive leap that its the same person winslet and stuart

school to boost the schools william murdoch memorial prize cameron apologized on the dvd commentary but stated that there were officers who fired gunshots to enforce the women and children first policy according to cameron his depiction of murdoch is that of an honorable man not of a man gone bad or of a cowardly murderer he added im not sure youd find that same sense of responsibility and

in violation of the women and children first policy and that the boat had failed to return to rescue those struggling in the water he offered five pounds to each of the lifeboats crew which those critical of his conduct viewed as a bribe the duffgordons at the time and his wifes secretary in a letter written at the time and rediscovered in  stated that there had been no women or children

poor the gender roles played out unto death women first the stoicism and nobility of a bygone age the magnificence of the great ship matched in scale only by the folly of the men who drove her hellbent through the darkness and above all the lesson that life is uncertain the future unknowablethe unthinkable possible james cameronjames cameron had a fascination with shipwrecks and for him the rms titanic was the mount everest of shipwrecks he was almost past the point in his life when he felt he could consider an undersea expedition but said he still had a mental restlessness to live the life he had turned away from when he switched from the sciences to the arts in college so when an imax film was made from footage shot of the wreck itself he decided to seek hollywood funding to pay for an expedition and do the same thing it was not because i particularly wanted to make the movie cameron said i wanted to dive to the shipwreckcameron wrote a scriptment for a titanic film met with th century fox executives including peter chernin and pitched it as romeo and juliet on the titanic cameron stated they were like oooooohkaaaaaay  a threehour romantic epic sure thats just what we want is there a little bit of terminator in that any harrier jets shootouts or car chases i said no no no its not like that the studio was dubious about the ideas commercial prospects but hoping for a long term relationship with cameron they gave him a greenlightcameron convinced fox to promote the film based on the publicity afforded by shooting the titanic wreck itself and organized several dives to the site over a period of two years my pitch on that had to be a little more detailed said cameron so i said look weve got to do this whole opening where theyre exploring the titanic and they find the diamond so were going to have all these shots of the ship cameron stated now we can either do them with elaborate models and motion control shots and cg and all that which will cost x amount of money  or we can spend x plus  per cent and actually go shoot it at the real wreck the crew shot at the real wreck in the atlantic ocean twelve times in  and actually spent more time with the ship than its passengers at that depth with a water pressure of  pounds per square inch one small flaw in the vessels superstructure would mean instant death for all on board not only were the dives highrisk but adverse conditions prevented cameron from getting the high quality footage that he wanted during one dive one of the submersibles collided with titanics hull damaging both sub and ship and leaving fragments of the submersibles propeller shroud scattered around the superstructure the external bulkhead of captain smiths quarters collapsed exposing the interior the area around the entrance to the grand staircase was also damageddescending to the actual site made both cameron and crew want to live up to that level of reality but there was another level of reaction coming away from the real wreck which was that it wasnt just a story it wasnt just a drama he said it was an event that happened to real people who really died working around the wreck for so much time you get such a strong sense of the profound sadness and injustice of it and the message of it cameron stated you think there probably arent going to be many filmmakers who go to titanic there may never be another one  maybe a documentarian due to this he felt a great mantle of responsibility to convey the emotional message of it  to do that part of it right tooafter filming the underwater shots cameron began writing the screenplay he wanted to honor the people who died during the sinking so he spent six months researching all of the titanics crew and passengers i read everything i could i created an extremely detailed timeline of the ships few days and a very detailed timeline of the last night of its life he said and i worked within that to write the script and i got some historical experts to analyze what id written and comment on it and i adjusted it he paid meticulous attention to detail even including a scene depicting the californians role in titanics demise though this was later cut see below from the beginning of the shoot they had a very clear picture of what happened on the ship that night i had a library that filled one whole wall of my writing office with titanic stuff because i wanted it to be right especially if we were going to dive to the ship he said that set the bar higher in a way  it elevated the movie in a sense we wanted this to be a definitive visualization of this moment in history as if youd gone back in a time machine and shot itcameron felt the titanic sinking was like a great novel that really happened but that the event had become a mere morality tale the film would give audiences the experience of living the history the treasure hunter brock lovett represented those who never connected with the human element of the tragedy while the blossoming romance of jack and rose cameron believed would be the most engaging part of the story when their love is finally destroyed the audience would mourn the loss he said all my films are love stories but in titanic i finally got the balance right its not a disaster film its a love story with a fastidious overlay of real history cameron framed the romance with the elderly rose to make the intervening years palpable and poignant for him the end of the film is left open to interpretation regarding whether or not elderly rose is dreaming or has died in her sleep he said that although he knows what he intended with the ending he will not reveal its intention adding the answer has to be something you supply personally individuallyscale modelinga ship resembling the titanic is being built at a port with clear skies and small wavesthe reconstruction of the rms titanic the blueprints were supplied by the original ships builder and cameron tried to make the ship as detailed and accurate as possibleharland and wolff the rms titanics builders opened their private archives to the crew sharing blueprints that were thought lost for the ships interiors production designer peter lamonts team looked for artifacts from the era the newness of the ship meant every prop had to be made from scratch fox acquired  acres of waterfront south of playas de rosarito in mexico and began building a new studio on may   a horizon tank of seventeen million gallons was built for the exterior of the reconstructed ship providing  degrees of ocean view the ship was built to full scale but lamont removed redundant sections on the superstructure and forward well deck for the ship to fit in the tank with the remaining sections filled with digital models the lifeboats and funnels were shrunk by ten percent the boat deck and adeck were working sets but the rest of the ship was just steel plating within was a fiftyfoot lifting platform for the ship to tilt during the sinking sequences towering above was a  feet  m tall tower crane on  feet  m of rail track acting as a combined construction lighting and camera platformthe sets representing the interior rooms of the titanic were reproduced exactly as originally built using photographs and plans from the titanics builders the liners first class staircase which figures prominently in the script was constructed out of real wood and actually destroyed in the filming of the sinking the rooms the carpeting design and colors individual pieces of furniture decorations chairs wall paneling cutlery and crockery with the white star line crest on each piece completed ceilings and costumes were among the designs true to the originals cameron additionally hired two titanic historians don lynch and ken marschall to authenticate the historical detail in the filmproductionthe modern day scenes of the expedition were shot on the akademik mstislav keldysh in july  principal photography for titanic began in september  at the newly built fox baja studios the poop deck was built on a hinge which could rise from zero to ninety degrees in a few seconds as the ships stern rose during the sinking for the safety of the stuntmen many props were made of foam rubber by november  the boarding scenes were being shot cameron chose to build his rms titanic on the starboard side as a study of weather data showed prevailing northtosouth wind which blew the funnel smoke aft this posed a problem for shooting the ships departure from southampton as it was docked on its port side any writing on props and costumes had to be reversed and if someone walked to their right in the script they had to walk left during shooting in postproduction the film was flipped to the correct directiona fulltime etiquette coach was hired to instruct the cast on the manners of the upper class gentility in  despite this several critics picked up on anachronisms in the film not least involving the two main starsa pencildrawing sketch depicting a woman with a somewhat stern face lying on a chair and pillow naked only wearing a diamond necklace from the breast down the picture is cut offcloseup shot of camerons nude rose sketch with the heart of the ocean the nude scene was one of the first scenes shot as the main set was not yet readycameron sketched jacks nude portrait of rose for a scene which he feels has the backdrop of repression you know what it means for her the freedom she must be feeling its kind of exhilarating for that reason he said the nude scene was dicaprio and winslets first scene together it wasnt by any kind of design although i couldnt have designed it better theres a nervousness and an energy and a hesitance in them cameron stated they had rehearsed together but they hadnt shot anything together if id had a choice i probably would have preferred to put it deeper into the body of the shoot he said he and his crew were just trying to find things to shoot because the big set was not yet ready it wasnt ready for months so we were scrambling around trying to fill in anything we could get to shoot after seeing the scene on film cameron felt it worked out considerably wellother times on the set were not as smooth the shoot was an arduous experience that cemented camerons formidable reputation as the scariest man in hollywood he became known as an uncompromising hardcharging perfectionist and a decibel screamer a modernday captain bligh with a megaphone and walkietalkie swooping down into peoples faces on a ft crane winslet chipped a bone in her elbow during filming and had been worried that she would drown in the mgallon water tank the ship was to be sunk in there were times when i was genuinely frightened of him jim has a temper like you wouldnt believe she said god damn it he would yell at some poor crew member thats exactly what i didnt want her costar bill paxton was familiar with camerons work ethic from his earlier experience with him there were a lot of people on the set jim is not one of those guys who has the time to win hearts and minds he said the crew felt that cameron had an evil alter ego and nicknamed him mij jim spelt backwards in response to the criticism cameron stated filmmaking is war a great battle between business and aestheticsduring shooting on the akademik mstislav keldysh an angry crew member put the dissociative drug pcp into the soup that cameron and various others ate one night which sent more than  people to the hospital there were people just rolling around completely out of it some of them said they were seeing streaks and psychedelics said actor lewis abernathy cameron managed to vomit before the drug took a full hold abernathy was shocked at the way he looked one eye was completely red like the terminator eye a pupil no iris beet red the other eye looked like hed been sniffing glue since he was four the person behind the poisoning was never caughtthe filming schedule was intended to last  days but grew to  many cast members came down with colds flu or kidney infections after spending hours in cold water including winslet in the end she decided she would not work with cameron again unless she earned a lot of money several others left and three stuntmen broke their bones but the screen actors guild decided following an investigation that nothing was inherently unsafe about the set additionally dicaprio said there was no point when he felt he was in danger during filming cameron believed in a passionate work ethic and never apologized for the way he ran his sets although he acknowledgedim demanding and im demanding on my crew in terms of being kind of militaresque i think theres an element of that in dealing with thousands of extras and big logistics and keeping people safe i think you have to have a fairly strict methodology in dealing with a large number of peoplethe costs of filming titanic eventually began to mount and finally reached  million fox executives panicked and suggested an hour of specific cuts from the threehour film they argued the extended length would mean fewer showings thus less money even though long epics are more likely to help directors win oscars cameron refused telling fox you want to cut my movie youre going to have to fire me you want to fire me youre going to have to kill me the executives did not want to start over because it would mean the loss of their entire investment but they also initially rejected camerons offer of forfeiting his share of the profits as an empty gesture they felt that profits would be unlikely cameron explained forfeiting his share as complex the short version is that the film cost proportionally much more than t and true lies those films went up seven or eight percent from the initial budget titanic also had a large budget to begin with but it went up a lot more said cameron as the producer and director i take responsibility for the studio thats writing the checks so i made it less painful for them i did that on two different occasions they didnt force me to do it they were glad that i didpostproductioneffectscameron wanted to push the boundary of special effects with his film and enlisted digital domain to continue the developments in digital technology which the director pioneered while working on the abyss and terminator  judgment day many previous films about the rms titanic shot water in slow motion which did not look wholly convincing he encouraged them to shoot their foot  m long miniature of the ship as if were making a commercial for the white star line afterwards digital water and smoke were added as were extras captured on a motion capture stage visual effects supervisor rob legato scanned the faces of many actors including himself and his children for the digital extras and stuntmen there was also a foot  m long model of the ships stern that could break in two repeatedly the only miniature to be used in water for scenes set in the ships engines footage of the ss jeremiah obriens engines were composited with miniature support frames and actors shot against a greenscreen in order to save money the first class lounge was a miniature set incorporated into a greenscreen backdropthe titanic about to sink into the ocean with the ship breaking into two parts and with smoke still coming out of the funnelsunlike previous titanic films camerons retelling of the disaster showed the ship breaking into two pieces before sinking entirely the scenes were an account of the moments most likely outcome camerons film was the second titanic film to show the ship breaking in half after the  television movie titanican enclosed  us gallons  l tank was used for sinking interiors in which the entire set could be tilted into the water in order to sink the grand staircase  us gallons  l of water were dumped into the set as it was lowered into the tank unexpectedly the waterfall ripped the staircase from its steelreinforced foundations although no one was hurt the foot  m long exterior of the rms titanic had its first half lowered into the tank but being the heaviest part of the ship meant it acted as a shock absorber against the water to get the set into the water cameron had much of the set emptied and even smashed some of the promenade windows himself after submerging the dining saloon three days were spent shooting lovetts rov traversing the wreck in the present the postsinking scenes in the freezing atlantic were shot in a  us gallons  l tank where the frozen corpses were created by applying a powder on actors that crystallized when exposed to water and wax was coated on hair and clothesthe climactic scene which features the breakup of the ship directly before it sinks as well as its final plunge to the bottom of the atlantic involved a tilting fullsized set  extras and  stunt performers cameron criticized previous titanic films for depicting the final plunge of the liner as sliding gracefully underwater he wanted to depict it as the terrifyingly chaotic event that it really was when carrying out the sequence people needed to fall off the increasingly tilting deck plunging hundreds of feet below and bouncing off of railings and propellers on the way down a few attempts to film this sequence with stunt people resulted in some minor injuries and cameron halted the more dangerous stunts the risks were eventually minimized by using computer generated people for the dangerous fallseditingthere was one crucial historical fact cameron chose to omit from the film  the ship that was close to the titanic but had turned off its radio for the night and did not hear their sos calls yes the ss californian that wasnt a compromise to mainstream filmmaking that was really more about emphasis creating an emotional truth to the film stated cameron he said there were aspects of retelling the sinking that seemed important in pre and postproduction but turned out to be less important as the film evolved the story of the californian was in there we even shot a scene of them switching off their marconi radio set said cameron but i took it out it was a clean cut because it focuses you back onto that world if titanic is powerful as a metaphor as a microcosm for the end of the world in a sense then that world must be selfcontainedduring the first assembly cut cameron altered the planned ending which had given resolution to brock lovetts story in the original version of the ending brock and lizzy see the elderly rose at the stern of the boat and fear she is going to commit suicide rose then reveals that she had the heart of the ocean diamond all along but never sold it in order to live on her own without cals money she tells brock that life is priceless and throws the diamond into the ocean after allowing him to hold it after accepting that treasure is worthless brock laughs at his stupidity rose then goes back to her cabin to sleep whereupon the film ends in the same way as the final version in the editing room cameron decided that by this point the audience would no longer be interested in brock lovett and cut the resolution to his story so that rose is alone when she drops the diamond he also did not want to disrupt the audiences melancholy after the titanics sinkingthe version used for the first test screening featured a fight between jack and lovejoy which takes place after jack and rose escape into the flooded dining saloon but the test audiences disliked it the scene was written to give the film more suspense and featured cal falsely offering to give lovejoy his valet the heart of the ocean if he can get it from jack and rose lovejoy goes after the pair in the sinking first class dining room just as they are about to escape him lovejoy notices roses hand slap the water as it slips off the table behind which she is hiding in revenge for framing him for the theft of the necklace jack attacks him and smashes his head against a glass window which explains the gash on lovejoys head that can be seen when he dies in the completed version of the film in their reactions to the scene test audiences said it would be unrealistic to risk ones life for wealth and cameron cut it for this reason as well as for timing and pacing reasons many other scenes were cut for similar reasonsmusic and soundtrackmain articles titanic music from the motion picture and back to titanicthe soundtrack album for titanic was composed by james horner for the vocals heard throughout the film subsequently described by earle hitchner of the wall street journal as evocative horner chose norwegian singer sissel kyrkjeb mononymously known as sissel horner knew sissel from her album innerst i sjelen and he particularly liked how she sang eg veit i himmerik ei borg i know in heaven there is a castle he had tried twentyfive or thirty singers before he finally chose sissel as the voice to create specific moods within the filmhorner additionally wrote the song my heart will go on in secret with will jennings because cameron did not want any songs with singing in the film cline dion agreed to record a demo with the persuasion of her husband ren anglil horner waited until cameron was in an appropriate mood before presenting him with the song after playing it several times cameron declared his approval although worried that he would have been criticized for going commercial at the end of the movie cameron also wanted to appease anxious studio executives and saw that a hit song from his movie could only be a positive factor in guaranteeing its completionreleaseinitial screeningth century fox and paramount pictures cofinanced titanic with paramount handling the north american distribution and fox handling the international release they

most expensive film ever made at the time when it was shown to the press in autumn of  it was with massive forebodings since the people in charge of the screenings believed they were on the verge of losing their jobs  because of this great albatross of a picture on which finally two studios had to combine to share the great load of its making cameron also thought he was headed for disaster at one point during filming we labored the last six months on titanic in the absolute knowledge that the studio would lose m it was a certainty he stated as the film neared release particular venom was spat at cameron for what was seen as his hubris and monumental extravagance a film critic for the los angeles times wrote that camerons overweening pride has come close to capsizing this project and that the film was a hackneyed completely derivative copy of old hollywood romancesits hard to forget the director on the stage of the shrine auditorium in la exultant pumping a golden oscar statuette into the air and shouting im the king of the world as everyone knew that was the most famous line in titanic exclaimed by leonardo dicaprios character as he leaned into the wind on the prow of the doomed vessel camerons incantation of the line was a giant eff off in front of a television audience approaching a billion to all the naysayers especially those sitting right in front of him christopher goodwin of the times on camerons response to titanics criticismwhen the film became a success with an unprecedented box office performance it was credited as the love story that stole the worlds hearts the first batch of people to see it were gob smacked by the sheer scale and intimacy of the production they emerged from the cinema tear stained and emotionally flabbergasted the film was playing on  screens ten weeks after it opened and out of its fifteen straight weeks on top of the charts jumped  in total sales in its ninth week of release it earned over  million a week for ten weeks and after  weeks was still bringing in more than m a week th century fox estimated that seven percent of american teenage girls had seen titanic twice by its fifth week although young women who saw the film several times and subsequently caused leomania were often credited with having primarily propelled the film to its alltime box office record other reports have attributed the films success to positive word of mouth and repeat viewership due to the love story combined with the groundbreaking special effectsthe films impact on men has also been especially credited now considered one of the films that make men cry msnbcs ian hodder stated that men admire jacks sense of adventure stowing away on a steamship bound for america we cheer as he courts a girl who was out of his league we admire how he suggests nude modeling as an excuse to get naked so when the tragic ending happens an uncontrollable flood of tears sinks our composure he said titanics ability to make men cry was briefly parodied in the  film zombieland where character tallahassee woody harrelson when recalling the death of his young son states i havent cried like that since titanic also addressing the sentimentality of the film benjamin willcock of dvdactivecom said that as a fourteenyearold male he had wanted to see starship troopers instead but was overruled by an uncle and friends little did i know that i would be seeing a film that would become the biggest most successful motion picture event of all time he stated i was also blissfully unaware that it would turn out to be so much more than some epic love storyin  the bbc analyzed the stigma over men crying during titanic and films in general middleaged men are not supposed to cry during movies stated finlo rohrer of the website citing the ending of titanic as having generated such tears adding that men if they have felt weepy during this film have often tried to be surreptitious about it professor mary beth oliver of penn state university stated for many men there is a great deal of pressure to avoid expression of female emotions like sadness and fear from a very young age males are taught that it is inappropriate to cry and these lessons are often accompanied by a great deal of ridicule when the lessons arent followed she said indeed some men who might sneer at the idea of crying during titanic will readily admit to becoming choked up during saving private ryan or platoon for men in general the idea of sacrifice for a brother is a more suitable source of emotiontitanics catchphrase im the king of the world became one of the film industrys more popular quotations according to richard harris a psychology professor at kansas state university who studied why people like to cite films in social situations using film quotations in everyday conversation is similar to telling a joke and a way to form solidarity with others people are doing it to feel good about themselves to make others laugh to make themselves laugh he saidcameron explained the films success as having significantly benefited from the experience of sharing when people have an experience thats very powerful in the movie theatre they want to go share it they want to grab their friend and bring them so that they can enjoy it he said they want to be the person to bring them the news that this is something worth having in their life thats how titanic worked media awareness network stated the normal repeat viewing rate for a blockbuster theatrical film is about  the repeat rate for titanic was over  the box office receipts were even more impressive when factoring in the films  hour and  minute length meant that it could only be shown three times a day compared to a normal movies four showings in response to this many theatres started midnight showings and were rewarded with full houses until almost  amtitanic held the record for box office gross for twelve years camerons followup film avatar was considered the first film with a genuine chance at surpassing its worldwide gross and did so in  various explanations for why the film was able to successfully challenge titanic were given for one twothirds of titanics haul was earned overseas and avatar tracked similarly avatar opened in  markets globally and was no  in all of them and the markets such as russia where titanic saw modest receipts in  and  are whitehot today with more screens and moviegoers than ever before brandon gray president of box office mojo said that while avatar may beat titanics revenue record the film is unlikely to surpass titanic in attendance ticket prices were about  cheaper in the late s in december  cameron had stated i dont think its realistic to try to topple titanic off its perch some pretty good movies have come out in the last few years titanic just struck some kind of chord in a january  interview he gave a different take on the matter once avatars performance was easier to predict its gonna happen its just a matter of time he saidcritical receptiontitanic received critical acclaim from film critics and was positively reviewed by audiences and scholars who commented on the films cultural historical and political impacts it holds an overall  approval rating on review aggregator website rotten tomatoes based on  reviews with a rating average of  out of  the sites consensus reads a mostly unqualified

review in the los angeles times was particularly scathing dismissing the emotive elements he stated what really brings on the tears is camerons insistence that writing this kind of movie is within his
